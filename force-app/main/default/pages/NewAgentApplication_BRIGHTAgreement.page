                    <p>Bright MLS may at any time, without notice, and on reasonable grounds, deny (temporarily or permanently) Subscriber’s access to the Bright MLS Service or an Authorized Feed to enforce the terms of this Agreement, to protect its name and goodwill, its business, or other Subscribers. Bright MLS may terminate this Agreement immediately, without opportunity to cure, in the event: (i) of Subscriber’s non-performance or breach of this Agreement; (ii) applicable law requires; or (iii) Bright MLS deems termination to be necessary to avoid liability.</p> 
                   
                    <p>Broker of Record may terminate their Subscription to the Bright MLS Service by sending Bright MLS notice of termination 30 days prior to the end of their then-current billing cycle. All applicable provisions of this Agreement will survive termination. If Broker of Record’s Subscription is terminated, the subscription of any affiliated Subscriber will also be terminated.</p> 
                   
                    <p>A Licensee may terminate their Subscription to the Bright MLS Service by having their Broker of Record send Bright MLS notice 30 days prior to the end of the quarter that Licensee is no longer affiliated with the Brokerage. A Licensee may change their Brokerage affiliation by submitting an online Subscriber transfer request and having the new Broker of Record approve the transfer electronically, or by submitting a written Subscriber transfer request notification authorized by the new Broker of Record, within 5 days of the transfer. All applicable provisions of this Agreement will survive the termination or transfer of Licensee’s Subscription.</p> 
                    
                    <p>To avoid automatic renewal of this Agreement, termination notices must be received by Bright MLS at least 10 days prior to the next renewal subscription start date. Notices of termination may be provided via email or mail.</p> 
                    
                    <p>Upon termination of this Agreement, all licenses granted in this Agreement to Subscriber immediately terminate. Bright MLS may deactivate Subscriber’s account, and no further access to the Bright MLS Service is authorized. Subscriber must immediately stop and discontinue all distribution and use of IDX and/or VOW Content and products utilizing IDX and/or VOW Content. Notwithstanding any term or condition to the contrary, in the event that Bright MLS terminates this Agreement for breach, Subscriber waives any pre-termination notice, arbitration, or other process as may be provided in the Bright MLS Subscription Documents.</p> 
                    
                    <p><strong>Ownership. </strong> All copyrights and other right, title, and interest in and to the Bright MLS Service, the Bright MLS Database, and Bright MLS Content remain with Bright MLS and its Licensors.

                    <p>To strengthen Bright MLS’s ability to protect Listing Content, and as a condition of accessing the Bright MLS Service, you assign and transfer to Bright MLS all right, title, and interest in and to the copyrights associated with the selection, coordination, and arrangement of Listing Content. This does not represent an assignment of rights as to the Listing Content itself; all copyrights and other right, title, and interest in Listing Content submitted by you remains vested in the Broker of Record.</p> 
                    
                    <p><strong>Protecting the Bright MLS Service.</strong> Subscribers may not permit anyone to: (i) copy, translate, create a derivative work of, reverse engineer, reverse assemble, disassemble, or decompile the Bright MLS Service or any part thereof or otherwise attempt to discover any source code or modify the Bright MLS Service in any manner or form; (ii) use unauthorized, modified versions of the Bright MLS Service, including without limitation for the purpose of building a similar or competitive product or service or for the purpose of obtaining unauthorized access to the Bright MLS Service; (iii) publish, post, upload, or otherwise transmit Listing Content or any other material that contains any viruses, Trojan horses, worms, time bombs, malware, ransomware, corrupted files, or other computer-programming routines that are intended to damage, detrimentally interfere with, surreptitiously intercept or expropriate any systems, data, personal information or property of another; (iv)use or knowingly permit the use of any security testing tools in order to probe, scan or attempt to penetrate or ascertain the security of the Bright MLS Service; or (v) use the Bright MLS Service for service bureau use, outsourcing, renting, reselling, sublicensing, or time-sharing.</p> 
                    
                    <p>Bright MLS reserves the right to investigate, involve, and, as Bright MLS may deem appropriate, cooperate with appropriate authorities regarding any activities involving the Bright MLS Service.

                    <p><strong>Homeowner Information. </strong> Bright MLS respects the requests of homeowners to remove from public display Bright MLS Content that contains personal or sensitive information, even if it does not rise to the level of personally identifiable information as defined by law. Subscriber shall (i) remove, promptly upon request, any personal information that a homeowner reasonably requests be removed from the Subscriber’s Listing Content, or that may be required to be removed pursuant to applicable law; (ii) not utilize the Bright MLS Content to broadcast or otherwise publicize information about an individual, unless Bright MLS and the individual provide written authorization to do so; (iii) abide by all prevailing federal, state, and local laws governing fair information practices and rights to privacy, or otherwise applicable to the use of personal information; and (iv) limit access to individual’s information to those who have a “need to know” to fulfill the terms of this Agreement, in connection with Subscriber’s business. </p>

                    <p><strong>Excluded Damages. </strong> SUBSCRIBER AGREES THAT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL BRIGHT MLS (OR ITS LICENSORS) BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF BUSINESS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF CONTENT, OR OTHER SIMILAR DAMAGES) ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. FURTHER, BRIGHT MLS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES OCCASIONED BY THE ACTS OR OMISSIONS, WHETHER INTENTIONAL OR NOT, OF BRIGHT MLS’S SUBSCRIBERS OR OTHERS WHO INPUT OR GENERATE ANY PART OF THE CONTENT INCLUDED IN THE BRIGHT MLS DATABASE. </p> 
                    
                    <p><strong>Maximum Aggregate Liability. </strong> TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE AGGREGATE, CUMULATIVE LIABILITY OF BRIGHT MLS TO ANY SUBSCRIBER ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED IN THE AGGREGATE SUBSCRIBER’S ACTUAL DIRECT DAMAGES, IF ANY, UP TO THE AMOUNT OF FEES PAID TO BRIGHT MLS DURING THE ONE YEAR PRECEDING THE EARLIEST EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE LIABILITY. RECOVERY OF DAMAGES UP TO SUCH AMOUNT WILL BE SUBSCRIBER’S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY.</p> 
                     
                    <p><strong>Indemnification. </strong> Subscriber shall indemnify, defend, and hold Bright MLS and its officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives, licensors, shareholders, and other Subscribers harmless from and against all liability, damages, loss, or expense (including reasonable attorneys’ fees, damages paid to third parties, cost of repairs or replacements, and costs of enforcement of this provision) arising from or related to any investigation, claim, demand, action, or proceeding initiated by any third party against any of them based upon: (i) any Listing Content or other content uploaded by Subscriber (or by the Non-licensed Personnel associated with Subscriber’s account) to the Bright MLS Service; (ii) the infringement of any proprietary or contract right of any third party as a result of the use or availability of any such Listing Content or other content that is associated with Subscriber’s account; (iii) any unauthorized use of Subscriber’s Account Information prior to notifying Bright MLS of such unauthorized use; (iv) any unauthorized use of the Bright MLS Service in whole or in part by Subscriber or any of Subscriber’s authorized users; (v) any other violation of this Agreement; or (vi) violations of terms and conditions of third party licensors of Bright MLS making services or content available through the Bright MLS Service. Subscriber agrees to assist Bright MLS, at Subscriber’s expense, in the defense or settlement of any claim to which this indemnification obligation applies. The rights described in this section are in addition to, and are not intended to limit, any other right or remedy available to Bright MLS. </p> 
                     
                    <p><strong>Injunctive Relief. </strong>  Because breach of this Agreement or the misappropriation of any intellectual property of Bright MLS or its licensors will cause irreparable injury for which remedies at law will be insufficient and/or difficult to quantify, Bright MLS has the right to seek injunctive or equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction, without the necessity of posting bond or any other surety. </p> 
                    
                    <p><strong>Audits of Compliance. </strong> Bright MLS may, at its own cost, review and inspect Subscriber’s records to the extent reasonably necessary to ascertain Subscriber’s compliance with this Agreement. Bright MLS will not be liable for any out-of-pocket costs that Subscriber incurs in connection with any Audit. The provisions of this Section survive the expiration or other termination of this Agreement for one year. </p> 
                     
                    <p><strong>Dispute Resolution. </strong>  Except for the right of Bright MLS to seek injunctive relief or other equitable remedies, and except for Bright MLS’s right to bring suit to protect its confidential information and intellectual property rights, all disputes relating to this Agreement that are not informally resolved may only be settled by binding arbitration pursuant to the American Arbitration Association under its Commercial Arbitration Rules, before three arbitrators, sitting in Washington, D.C., on an individual basis and not aggregated with the claims of any third party; class action arbitration is prohibited. </p> 
                     
                    <p><strong>Entire Agreement; Miscellaneous Terms. </strong> This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements regarding its subject matter. Neither Bright MLS nor Subscriber may be liable for any delay or failure due to force majeure events. Subscriber may not assign this Agreement; Bright MLS may assign this Agreement upon notice to Subscriber or without notice if assigned to a commonly owned or controlled entity. This Agreement is entered into solely between, and may be enforced only by, Bright MLS and Subscriber, and this Agreement does not create any rights in any third parties. Unless Bright MLS specifies otherwise, all notices, including notices of address changes must be in writing and given when mailed by certified mail to the attention of Bright MLS Chief Executive Officer at Bright MLS’s address. This Agreement is governed by, and shall be construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware. Bright MLS may in its discretion make changes to the terms of this Agreement and will provide notice of the updated terms for Subscriber’s review; Subscriber’s continued use of the Bright MLS Service constitutes Subscriber’s acceptance of any changes.</p>
