Vendor shall immediately give notice to Bright MLS of any unauthorized use or disclosure of Bright MLS’s Confidential Information of which it becomes aware. At Vendor’s sole cost and expense, Vendor agrees to assist Bright MLS in remedying any such unauthorized use or disclosure of Bright MLS’s Confidential Information. </p>

    <p style="padding-left:25px;"><b>8.3 Ownership and Return of Confidential Information and Other Materials.</b>  Bright MLS’s Confidential Information is and shall remain Bright MLS’s property, and this Agreement does not grant or imply any license or other rights to Bright MLS’s Confidential Information except as expressly set forth in this Agreement.  Within 5 business days after expiration or termination of this Agreement or upon Bright MLS’s request, Vendor shall destroy any Bright MLS Confidential Information in its possession or under its control, including all copies thereof, and certify to Bright MLS in writing that it has complied with this obligation. </p>

    <p><b>9. Term and Termination.</b></p>
    <p style="padding-left:25px;"><b>9.1 Term.</b> If Vendor is providing services in support of more than one Licensed Site, then the term of this Agreement shall expire with the last applicable active Licensed Site to expire, otherwise, the term of this Agreement begins on the Effective Date and runs for one calendar year, unless terminated earlier as provided in the Agreement. Unless terminated, this Agreement shall renew automatically for successive, one-year periods on each anniversary of the Effective Date. </p>
    <p style="padding-left:25px;"><b>9.2 Termination.</b> This Agreement shall terminate upon the occurrence of any of the following events: (i) Vendor has no Licensed Sites for which Vendor is contracted to provide services for a Subscriber; (ii) Vendor fails to cure any breach of its obligations under this Agreement, including payment of the annual access fee, after receipt of notice from Bright MLS in accordance with Section 11; or (iii) Bright MLS’s notice to Vendor that this Agreement is terminated. Bright MLS has the right at any time and at its sole discretion to terminate this Agreement.</p>
    <p style="padding-left:25px;"><b>9.3 Effects of Termination.</b>  Upon termination for any reason, (i) Vendor shall immediately stop and discontinue any and all distribution and use of IDX Content and products utilizing IDX Content; (ii) all licenses granted hereunder to Vendor shall immediately terminate; (iii) within ten (10) days of such termination, Vendor shall erase or otherwise destroy the IDX Content, in a manner that prevents un-erasure or reconstitution of the data, and shall provide evidence of such compliance to Bright MLS; and (iv) Vendor shall promptly pay all fees then-due to Bright MLS, if any. Any termination of this Agreement will be without prejudice to rights created or granted or obligations incurred hereunder prior to such termination.</p>
    
    <p><b>10. Audits of Compliance.</b>  Bright MLS may, or at its option may engage an independent third party to, review, inspect, and test the books, records, equipment, and facilities of Vendor to the extent reasonably necessary to ascertain Vendor’s compliance with this Agreement (“Audit”). Bright MLS may conduct an Audit during normal business hours of Vendor. Audit activities may include, without limitation, obtaining full access to Vendor’s websites (including mobile applications) and systems to ensure that IDX Content is displayed in accordance with this Agreement. Bright MLS shall have the right to conduct the Audit using all features available to end-users of Vendor’s systems that employ the IDX Content; and posing as consumers to register and test services Vendor makes available to consumers using the IDX Content.

If Vendor fails to cure said breach, Bright MLS shall have the right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 9.  If Bright MLS notifies Vendor of any breach by any Subscriber of the terms of a Subscriber IDX License Agreement relating to any Licensed Site for which Vendor provides services, Vendor agrees to immediately discontinue the display and distribution of IDX Content to such Licensed Site until such time as Bright MLS may notify Vendor that such breach has been cured.  Vendor’s failure to discontinue display and distribution of IDX Content to any Licensed Site after notification of breach by Bright MLS will constitute a breach of Vendor’s obligations under this Agreement.</p>
    <p><b>12. Injunctive Relief.</b>  Vendor acknowledges that the Bright MLS Database and IDX Content are valuable assets to Bright MLS and that breach of this Agreement with respect to use of the IDX Content will result in irreparable harm to Bright MLS for which monetary damages may not be adequate. Bright MLS is therefore entitled to, in addition to all other forms of relief, injunctive relief as may be necessary to restrain any continuing or further breach by Vendor, without showing or proving any actual damages sustained by Bright MLS.</p>
    <p><b>13. Indemnification.</b> Vendor agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless, Bright MLS, its officers, employees, directors, agents and representatives from and against any and all suits, claims, losses, costs, liabilities, damages, taxes, interest, penalties and/or expenses incurred in investigations or defense of claims and actions resulting from or arising out of Vendor’s business operations, publications or advertisement and/or retransmission of IDX Content, or any breach of Vendor’s obligations, representations or warranties under this Agreement.</p>
    
    <p><b>14. Miscellaneous Provisions</b></p>
    <p style="padding-left:25px;"><b>14.1 Independent Contractors.</b> The Parties hereby agree that no agency, joint venture, or partnership is created by this Agreement and that the Parties are independent contractors to one another.</p>
    <p style="padding-left:25px;"><b>14.2 Assignment.</b> Neither this Agreement nor any right or obligation hereunder shall be assigned or delegated, in whole or part, by all parties without the prior express written consent of the other Party; provided, however, that Bright MLS may, without notice or the written consent, assign this Agreement and its rights and delegate its obligations hereunder at any time to any subsidiary. Any purported assignment in violation of this section shall be void and of no effect.</p>
    <p style="padding-left:25px;"><b>14.3 Governing Law.</b>  This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the state of Delaware without regard to its choice of law provisions.  Except for the right of Bright MLS to seek injunctive relief or other equitable remedies, and except for Bright MLS’s right to bring suit to protect its confidential information and intellectual property rights, all disputes relating to this Agreement that are not informally resolved may only be settled by binding arbitration pursuant to the American Arbitration Association under its Commercial Arbitration Rules, before three arbitrators, sitting in Washington, D.C., on an individual basis and not aggregated with the claims of any third party; class action arbitration is prohibited.</p>
    <p style="padding-left:25px;"><b>14.4 Legal Fees.</b>  If Bright MLS prevails in any action to enforce or interpret this Agreement or any provision hereof, Vendor will pay Bright MLS’s reasonable attorney’s fees and costs for such legal action.</p>
    <p style="padding-left:25px;"><b>14.5 Modification.</b>  No amendment or modification of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement shall be valid or binding unless contained in a writing signed by the parties.</p>
    <p style="padding-left:25px;"><b>14.6 Severability.</b>  If any term, condition, or provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall, if possible, be interpreted rather than voided, to achieve the intent of the parties to this Agreement to the extent possible.  In any event, all other terms, conditions, and provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed valid and shall continue in full force and effect.</p>
